If you are sick
If you are sick
If you are sick
If you are sick of it If you are sick
If you are sick
If you are sick of it!
When everything you do Do not seem to matter.
You try but it is not use
Your world is getting blacker.
When every time you fail
Has no answer.
Every empty promise made
His own reminder.
No one can make this better
Take control, it is now or never!
Are you sick of it?
Raise your hands,
Get rid of it!
While there is a fighting chance.
Are you over it?
Bored to death?
Have you had enough regret?
Take a stand, raise your hands...
If you are sick of it!
If you are sick
If you are sick
If you are sick of it!
If you are sick of it!
If you are sick
If you are sick
If you are sick of it!
Every single day
I chase my own tail
Like the bad inside of me Has gotta get, gotta get, get away
I am running out of time
For me to break this.
I am tired of feeling like
I am never gonna make it.
No one can make this better
Take control, it is now or never!
Are you sick of it?
Raise your hands,
Get rid of it!
While there is a fighting chance.
Are you over it?
Bored to death?
Have you had enough regret?
Take a stand, raise your hands...
If you are sick of it!
If you are sick
If you are sick
